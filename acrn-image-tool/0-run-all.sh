# This script is to create a disk image with ACRN hypervisor and service
# OS. The final disk image can be used to "dd" to USB disk or hard disk,
# to run, or run in qemu/ovmf or simics emulator. At this time, Guest OS
# doesn't include the image. You can copy your guest os image into the 4th
# patition of ACRN_DISK_IMAGE.

# Make sure that system has the following commands before executing 
#     wget, curl, sha512sum, grep, sed, xz, basename, dirname,
#     guestmount/guestunmount, docker qemu-system_x86-64
