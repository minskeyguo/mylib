The scripts are to create a disk image to run acrn hypervisor and service OS.
It pulls opensourced code from github.com/projectacrn and clearlinux pk414 
git, build and then create a disk image.

Just run the first script (0-run-all.sh) to get an image, which can be used in
qemu/ovmf or simics.  The image can be "dd" to USB disk or hard disk to demo
acrn.

Currently, UOS doesn't include the image.  You can copy the UOS into the 4rd
parition of disk image.
